The devil is in the details. I am **Berke Antar**.

I am an Electronics & Communication Engineering student. My work spans a wide spectrum, from hardware-level signals to complex network security protocols.

I don't just research how systems work; I investigate **how they fail**, how they can be manipulated, and where their boundaries lie.

### 🏴 The Philosophy

> "To be the best locker, you need to be the best picklocker."

This is the core principle of my research. True security cannot exist without understanding the offensive perspective. In this lab, I document my journey into the deeper, often overlooked aspects of technology—moving beyond standard documentation to explore edge cases and vulnerabilities.

### 🛠 Tech Stack & Arsenal

Tools and technologies I use for research and development:

* **Cybersecurity:** OPSEC, OSINT, Burp Suite, Wireshark, Metasploit, Reverse Engineering.
* **Engineering:** Circuit Analysis, FPGA, Micro-controllers (STM32/ESP32), Signal Processing.
* **Programming:** Python, C/C++, Bash Scripting, JavaScript (Astro/React).
* **Environment:** Linux (Debian/Arch), MacOS (Unix-based workflows).

### 📡 Connect
